## Getting started

### Setting up the backend

The easiest way is to use bbchallenge's cosearch staging backend, create a `.env` file at the root and add the following to it:

`PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api-staging-cosearch.bbchallenge.org/`

Alternatively, you can also run the backend locally, see [cosearch-api](https://github.com/cosearch-lab/cosearch-api).

### Running the development server

```
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
